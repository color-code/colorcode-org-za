            <h3>What is ColorCode?</h3>
            <p>
              ColorCode is a place for anyone to learn how to code. We're not prescriptive about what people should learn, but are more
              keen on hearing about what problems people want to solve or what they want to do, and then set them on the right
              path to achieving those goals. We also want to encourage those who are under-represented in tech (i.e. women, People
              of Colour , LGBTQ etc) to participate and feel empowered.

              <h5>Why ColorCode?</h5>

                can learn how to solve problems with code, build websites or think about how tech can help their small business.

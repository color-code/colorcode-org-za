# colorcode-org-za
This is our simple web site, as a wordpress theme. Deployed at https://colorcode.org.za.

In order to make changes to the theme:
- zip this directory
- navigate [here](https://colorcode.org.za/wp-admin/theme-install.php?browse=featured) to manage the themes
- delete the old theme
- upload the new zip file
- preview it to make sure all is well
- activate and publish the new theme

(please note that this is by no way the definitive or recomended way to accomplish this task, but it works for now)
